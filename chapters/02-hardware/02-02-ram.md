# 02.02 – RAM (Random Access Memory)

## What is RAM?

**RAM** stands for **Random Access Memory**. It is the short-term memory of your computer.  
It stores the data and programs that are currently being used, so the CPU can access them quickly.

> Think of RAM as your desk: you put things you're working on there. If your desk is small, you can’t work on many things at once.

## Why RAM is Important

More RAM means:
- You can run more programs at the same time
- Your system responds faster
- You can work with bigger files (like spreadsheets or videos)

If you don’t have enough RAM, your computer may slow down or freeze.

## RAM vs Storage

**RAM** is not the same as a hard drive or SSD:

| RAM                      | Storage (HDD/SSD)        |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Temporary (clears on reboot) | Permanent (saves data)     |
| Very fast                | Slower                   |
| Small size (e.g. 8 GB)   | Large size (e.g. 512 GB) |

RAM is like your **workspace**. Storage is your **filing cabinet**.

## How Much RAM Do You Need?

It depends on what you do:

- **4 GB** – Basic tasks (browsing, email)
- **8 GB** – Standard office work
- **16+ GB** – Heavy multitasking, video editing, programming, gaming

> RAM doesn’t make your computer smarter — it just gives it more room to think.
