# 02.04 – Input and Output Devices

## What are Input and Output Devices?

A **computer can't work alone** — it needs ways to communicate with the user.  
These are called **input** and **output** devices.

- **Input devices** let you send information *to* the computer.  
- **Output devices** let the computer send information *to you*.

> Think of input as "speaking to the computer" and output as "the computer speaking to you."

- **Speakers** – output sound
- **Printer** – produces physical copies of digital files

## Devices That Do Both (I/O)

Some devices are both input and output:

- **Touchscreens** – input by touch, output by display
- **External drives** – read (input) and write (output) data
- **Network adapters** – send and receive data

## Why It Matters

Knowing about input and output helps you:
- Choose the right tools for tasks
- Troubleshoot problems (e.g., when your mic or printer isn’t working)
- Understand how data moves in and out of a computer

> A computer is only as useful as the way you interact with it.
