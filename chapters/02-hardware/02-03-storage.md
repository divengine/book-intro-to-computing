# 02.03 – Storage Devices

## What is Storage?

**Storage** refers to where your computer saves data **permanently** — even when it's turned off.  
It keeps your files, photos, videos, programs, and the operating system itself.

> If RAM is your desk, storage is your filing cabinet. You store things there for later use.
