# 02.01 – The CPU (Central Processing Unit)

## What is the CPU?

The **CPU** is the brain of the computer. It is responsible for carrying out instructions and performing calculations. Every time you click, type, open a file, or run a program, the CPU is at work.

> Just like your brain processes thoughts and actions, the CPU processes all tasks inside a computer.

## What Does the CPU Do?

The CPU performs **three key actions**:

1. **Fetch** – it gets instructions from memory
2. **Decode** – it understands what the instruction means
3. **Execute** – it performs the operation (like adding numbers or moving data)

These steps happen **millions or billions of times per second**.

## Parts of the CPU

Most CPUs have:

- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)** – does calculations and comparisons  
- **Control Unit** – directs the computer’s operation  
- **Registers** – small memory areas that store data being used right now

## How Fast is a CPU?

CPU speed is measured in **gigahertz (GHz)**.  
1 GHz = 1 billion cycles per second.  
More GHz usually means a faster processor, but other factors also matter (like the number of **cores**).

Modern CPUs often have:
- **2 to 16 cores** (or more)
- Smart features to run multiple tasks at once

## Why It Matters

Understanding the CPU helps you:
- Know why some computers are faster than others
- Understand why some tasks slow down your machine
- Make better choices when buying or upgrading a computer

> A powerful CPU means your computer can think fast. But even the best brain needs help from memory and storage — coming next.
