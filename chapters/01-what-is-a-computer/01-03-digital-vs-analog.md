# 01.03 – Digital vs Analog Computers

## Two Ways to Represent Information

All computers process **information**, but the way they represent and handle that information can be different.

There are two basic types:

- **Analog computers** – work with continuous signals  
- **Digital computers** – work with discrete values (like 0 and 1)

---

## Analog Computers

Analog computers use physical quantities like voltage, pressure, or speed to represent data.

**Examples:**
- Old thermometers (mercury level)
- Speedometers with moving needles
- Analog clocks with hands

They are great for **simulating real-world behavior** (like a flight simulator), but **less precise** and harder to reprogram.

---

## Digital Computers

Digital computers use **binary code** — a system of only two values: **0 and 1**.  
Everything (text, images, music, video) is converted into binary, processed, stored, and transmitted.

**Examples:**
- Laptops
- Smartphones
- Modern calculators
- Game consoles

Digital computers are **more precise**, **faster**, and **easy to program**, which is why they dominate today’s world.

## Why This Matters

Understanding the difference helps you realize:
- Why we use binary in computing
- How digital systems work under the hood
- That not all machines with displays are digital

> Modern computers are digital, but they come from a long history of analog tools that tried to solve the same problems.
