# 01.02 – A Brief History of Computers

## Early Beginnings

The idea of using tools to perform calculations goes back thousands of years. The **abacus**, developed in ancient times, is one of the earliest known computing tools.

In the 1600s, inventors like **Blaise Pascal** and **Gottfried Leibniz** created mechanical calculators to perform arithmetic automatically.

## The Mechanical Age

In the 1800s, **Charles Babbage** designed a machine called the **Analytical Engine**, considered the first concept of a general-purpose computer.  
His assistant, **Ada Lovelace**, wrote instructions for the machine — making her the first computer programmer.

These early machines worked with gears and levers, not electricity.

## The First Electronic Computers

During World War II, the first true electronic computers were developed.  
Examples:
- **ENIAC (1946)** – used for military calculations
- **Colossus (1943)** – used to break codes in Britain

These machines were huge, hot, and used vacuum tubes.

## The Rise of Personal Computers

In the 1970s and 1980s, computers became smaller, cheaper, and usable by regular people.

- **Apple II (1977)** – first mass-produced PC
- **IBM PC (1981)** – brought computing into offices and homes

Then came **laptops**, **tablets**, and **smartphones** — computers that fit in your bag or pocket.

## Computers Today

Now, computers are everywhere:  
in cars, phones, hospitals, schools, and even watches.

Modern computers are more powerful than entire buildings of machines from 50 years ago — and they fit in your hand.

> Understanding where computers come from helps us appreciate how powerful and useful they have become.
