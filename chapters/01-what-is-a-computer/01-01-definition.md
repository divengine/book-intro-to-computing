## Core Idea

All computers, no matter how different they look, share **four basic functions**:

1. **Input** – receiving data (keyboard, mouse, microphone)
2. **Processing** – working with the data (CPU)
3. **Storage** – saving data (hard drive, SSD, USB)
4. **Output** – showing results (monitor, printer, sound)

You can remember it as:  
**Input → Process → Output** (and sometimes **→ Storage**)
