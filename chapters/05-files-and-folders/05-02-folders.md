# 05.02 – Folders

## What is a Folder?

A **folder** (also called a directory) is a digital container that holds files and other folders.  
It helps organize your information so you can find and manage it easily.

> Think of folders like drawers in a filing cabinet. Files go inside them, grouped by topic or purpose.

## Why Use Folders?

Folders help you:
- Keep things tidy and easy to find
- Avoid cluttering your desktop or main drive
- Group related files together (e.g. school, work, music, photos)

Organized files = faster access, fewer mistakes, and peace of mind.

## Creating and Managing Folders

You can:
- Create a folder by right-clicking and selecting **New Folder**
- Give it a meaningful name (e.g. “Invoices 2025” or “School Projects”)
- Drag and drop files into it
- Create **subfolders** for deeper organization

Be consistent with naming and structure. Example:
```
Documents/
├── Work/
│   ├── Reports/
│   └── Invoices/
└── School/
    ├── Math/
    └── History/
```

## Folders vs Files

| Folder                  | File                       |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Holds files or other folders | Holds content (text, image, etc.) |
| Used for organization        | Used to store actual data       |
| Can be empty                 | Always contains something       |

## Best Practices

- Don’t save everything on the Desktop
- Use folders with clear names and categories
- Backup important folders regularly
- Avoid overly deep nesting (10 folders inside folders!)

> A well-organized folder system is the secret to staying productive.
