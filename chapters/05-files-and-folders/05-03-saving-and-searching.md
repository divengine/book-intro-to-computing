# 05.03 – Saving and Searching Files

## Saving a File

When you create something in a program (a document, a drawing, a spreadsheet), you must **save it** to keep it.

Saving means:
- Giving the file a name
- Choosing a location (folder)
- Selecting a format or extension

> If you don’t save, your work can be lost when the computer shuts down or crashes.

## Save vs Save As

- **Save** – updates the current file
- **Save As** – creates a new file or changes name/location/type

Use **Save As** when:
- You want to keep both the original and a new version
- You’re saving in a different folder or format (e.g. from `.docx` to `.pdf`)

---

## Common Save Locations

- **Documents** – for general files
- **Downloads** – for files from the internet
- **Desktop** – for quick access (avoid clutter!)
- **USB drive or external disk** – for backups or portability
- **Cloud folder** (Google Drive, OneDrive) – for online access

## Searching for Files

Most operating systems have a **search bar** to help you find files by:

- **Name**
- **Type** (e.g. `.pdf`)
- **Date modified**
- **Text inside the file** (in some cases)

Search helps when you forget where you saved something.

## Tips for Easy Saving and Searching

- Use clear, specific file names: `invoice-july2025.pdf` not `file123.pdf`
- Save in the correct folder from the start
- Backup important files to external or cloud storage
- Use folders to group files logically
- Learn how to use your system’s search function

> Saving properly means you can trust your computer to hold your work. Searching well means you’ll always find it.
