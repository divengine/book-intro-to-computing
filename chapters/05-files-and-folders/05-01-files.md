# 05.01 – Files

## What is a File?

A **file** is a container of information stored on a computer.  
It can hold text, images, video, music, or any kind of data.

> Think of a file like a digital sheet of paper — it has something written or stored on it.

## Types of Files

Every file has a **type** based on its purpose or content.  
You can usually tell by its **extension** (the part after the dot in the name).

**Examples:**

| Extension | File Type             | Example           |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------------|
| `.txt`    | Text file              | notes.txt         |
| `.docx`   | Word document          | report.docx       |
| `.jpg`    | Image (photo)          | family.jpg        |
| `.mp3`    | Audio                  | song.mp3          |
| `.mp4`    | Video                  | movie.mp4         |
| `.pdf`    | Portable Document      | manual.pdf        |
| `.exe`    | Executable (program)   | setup.exe         |

## File Names and Extensions

- The **name** is chosen by the user
- The **extension** tells the system how to open it
- Some systems hide extensions by default (especially Windows)

Avoid special characters in file names: ` / \ : * ? " < > | `

## Creating and Opening Files

You can:
- Create a new file using software (e.g. Save As…)
- Open a file by double-clicking or selecting it in an app
- Rename, move, or delete files using your file manager

Most operating systems offer **default apps** for common file types (e.g. PDF reader, photo viewer).

- Understanding file types helps avoid errors (e.g. opening a video with a text editor).
- Learning how to manage files helps you stay organized and efficient.

> Files are the building blocks of your digital life.
