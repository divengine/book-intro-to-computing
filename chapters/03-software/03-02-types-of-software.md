# 03.02 – Types of Software

## Two Main Categories

All software falls into two broad categories:

1. **System Software** – helps the computer work
2. **Application Software** – helps *you* do work

Let’s break them down.

## System Software

This type of software manages the computer itself.

**Examples:**
- **Operating System (OS)** – Windows, Linux, macOS
- **Device drivers** – tell the OS how to work with hardware (keyboard, printer, etc.)
- **Utilities** – tools that keep the system running (like antivirus or cleanup tools)

> System software runs in the background and supports everything else.

## Application Software

This type of software helps users perform tasks.

**Examples:**
- **Word processor** – to write documents
- **Spreadsheet** – to organize numbers and data
- **Browser** – to explore the internet
- **Media player** – to watch videos or listen to music
- **Games** – for entertainment

> If you can see it, click it, and use it — it’s probably application software.

## Specialized Software

Some software is designed for very specific tasks, like:
- Design (CAD, Photoshop)
- Programming (Visual Studio, VS Code)
- Accounting (QuickBooks, Wave)
- Education (learning platforms, typing tutors)

These are often used in workplaces or by professionals.
