# 03.01 – What is Software?

## Definition

**Software** is the set of instructions that tell a computer what to do.  
It’s not something you can touch — it lives inside the machine, guiding every action.

> If hardware is the body of a computer, software is the mind that controls it.

## Why Software Matters

Without software, a computer is just a box of metal and circuits.  
Software allows the hardware to:

- Receive input
- Perform tasks
- Show results
- Connect to the internet
- Play videos, run programs, and more

---

## Forms of Software

Software can appear as:

- Apps and programs (like a browser or word processor)
- The operating system (Windows, Linux, etc.)
- Games, tools, utilities
- Scripts or instructions in the background

Even something as simple as **pressing a key** runs software that tells the computer how to respond.

## Software vs Data

**Software** is what runs the computer.  
**Data** is what software uses or produces.

| Software         | Data               |
|------------------|--------------------|
| A music player   | The song you play  |
| A photo editor   | The image you edit |
| A spreadsheet    | The numbers you enter |

## Summary

- Software is **invisible** but essential  
- It **tells the hardware what to do**  
- Without software, computers **cannot function**

> Everything you see on screen is made possible by software.
