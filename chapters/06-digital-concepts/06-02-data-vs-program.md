# 06.02 – Data vs Program

## What is Data?

**Data** is raw information stored or processed by a computer.  
It can be numbers, text, images, audio, or anything else that represents content.

Examples:
- A list of student names  
- A photo  
- A table of sales figures  
- A video file

> Data is the “stuff” you work with: facts, values, and content.

## What is a Program?

A **program** is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to use or change the data.  
Programs are written by people using **programming languages**.

Examples:
- A word processor (to write and edit text)
- A browser (to open websites)
- A calculator (to compute numbers)

> Programs don’t store content — they act on content.

## Data and Program Together

They work as a team:

- A program **reads** data  
- A program **changes** data  
- A program **saves** new data

Example:
- You open a text file (data) in Word (program), edit it, and save it again.

## File Types Help Identify Roles

- `.txt`, `.jpg`, `.mp4` → **Data files**
- `.exe`, `.app`, `.sh` → **Program files**

Sometimes, programs create or use data files (e.g. `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.psd`) that contain both structure and content.

## Why It Matters

Understanding the difference helps you:
- Know what files are safe to open (data vs unknown programs)
- Organize your work better
- Understand how apps function and why they need certain data types

> Computers run programs, and programs work with data — that’s how digital life works.
