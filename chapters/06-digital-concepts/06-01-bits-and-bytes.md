# 06.01 – Bits and Bytes

## What is a Bit?

A **bit** is the smallest unit of information in a computer.  
It can only have one of two values: **0** or **1**.  
This is called **binary code** — the language computers understand.

> Think of a bit like a light switch: it’s either off (0) or on (1).

## What is a Byte?

A **byte** is made up of **8 bits**.  
One byte can represent one character, like a letter or number.

Example:
- The letter **A** in binary is `01000001`
- The number **5** in binary is `00000101`

## Larger Units of Data

As data grows, we use bigger units:

| Unit     | Size                   | Example                             |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1 Byte   | 8 bits                 | A single character (`A`, `7`, etc.) |
| 1 KB     | 1,024 bytes            | A short text document               |
| 1 MB     | 1,024 KB               | A photo or MP3 song                 |
| 1 GB     | 1,024 MB               | A movie or many apps                |
| 1 TB     | 1,024 GB               | A hard drive or backup disk         |

## Why Use Binary?

Computers are built with circuits and electricity.  
- A **0** means no signal (off)  
- A **1** means signal (on)

Binary is simple, reliable, and works well with electronic systems.

## Why It Matters

- Everything on a computer — text, images, video, sound — is stored using **bits and bytes**
- Knowing this helps you understand file sizes, memory, and storage limits
- Helps you think like a computer: in logical, step-by-step ways

> Bits and bytes are the building blocks of the digital world.
