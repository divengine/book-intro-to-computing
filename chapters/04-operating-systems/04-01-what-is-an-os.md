# 04.01 – What is an Operating System?

## Definition

An **Operating System (OS)** is the main software that manages all the hardware and other software on a computer.

It is the **first program** that loads when a computer starts, and it keeps running in the background the whole time.

> Without an operating system, a computer cannot be used.

## What the OS Does

The OS is responsible for:

- Starting the computer and loading system files
- Managing memory (RAM) and processing power
- Handling input and output devices
- Running applications
- Organizing files and folders
- Providing a user interface (menus, icons, windows)

## Common Operating Systems

- **Windows** – Most common OS for personal computers
- **macOS** – Used in Apple desktops and laptops
- **Linux** – Free and open-source; used by developers and servers
- **Android** – Used in smartphones and tablets
- **iOS** – Apple’s OS for mobile devices

Each OS has a different look, but they all do the same basic job.

## The OS in Action

When you:
- Turn on the computer → OS starts working
- Click a file → OS opens it with the right app
- Save a document → OS puts it in a folder
- Plug in a USB → OS installs a driver to read it

## Summary

The Operating System is the **core software** that:
- Connects all parts of your computer
- Makes everything else possible
- Gives you a way to use the machine

> A computer with no OS is like a car without a driver.
