# 04.02 – User Interfaces

## What is a User Interface?

A **User Interface (UI)** is how you interact with a computer.  
It’s the part of the operating system (or a program) that you can see and control.

> Without a user interface, you'd need to speak the computer’s language directly — and that’s not easy.

## Types of User Interfaces

### 1. Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Uses windows, icons, buttons, and menus
- Easy to learn and use
- Examples: Windows desktop, macOS, Android, iOS

### 2. Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Uses typed commands
- Requires specific knowledge (commands, syntax)
- Powerful and fast for advanced users
- Example: Linux terminal, Windows Command Prompt
