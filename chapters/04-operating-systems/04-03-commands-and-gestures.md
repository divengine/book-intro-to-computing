# 04.03 – Commands and Gestures

## How We Give Instructions

To use a computer, we need to **give it commands**.  
Depending on the interface, we can do this in different ways:

- **Typing commands** (in a terminal or console)
- **Clicking buttons** (with a mouse or tap)
- **Using gestures** (with fingers or hands)

> Commands and gestures are how we “talk” to a machine.

## Command Examples

### In a Terminal (CLI):

- `dir` → list files (Windows)
- `ls` → list files (Linux/macOS)
- `cd folder` → change folder
- `copy file1 file2` → copy a file

These commands require **precision** and are **powerful**, but not very forgiving.

---

## Gesture Examples (GUI or Touchscreen)

- **Click / Tap** – select or activate
- **Double-click** – open files or folders
- **Right-click** – show options
- **Swipe** – scroll through content
- **Pinch** – zoom in or out

Gestures are **intuitive** and easy to learn, used mostly in touchscreens and modern GUIs.

## Why Learn Both?

- **Commands** give you full control, especially in complex or technical tasks
- **Gestures** make everyday use faster and easier

Learning both helps you:
- Use any computer more effectively
- Switch between systems with confidence
- Feel in control of your tools

> Knowing how to interact with a computer is as important as knowing how it works.
